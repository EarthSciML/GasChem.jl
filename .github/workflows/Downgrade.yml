  # TEMPORARILY DISABLED: The Downgrade workflow cannot work while using the
  # Catalyst.jl fork (ctessum/Catalyst.jl#mtkv10-v2) because Catalyst v16 is not
  # in the General registry. The julia-downgrade-compat action fails with a
  # KeyError when trying to look up the Catalyst UUID, even when Catalyst is in
  # the skip list. Re-enable this workflow once Catalyst v16 is released.
